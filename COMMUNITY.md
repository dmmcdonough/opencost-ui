# The OpenCost Community Team

The wider OpenCost community identified work that falls into the categories of contributor experience, advocacy and communications, community management as integral to its success. This document outlines the responsibilities of the Community Maintainers, and links to OpenCost community resources. 

## Current Team Roster

See https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/MAINTAINERS.md#community-maintainers

## Responsibilities

As opposed to defining a big overarching burden of responsibilities the team would have a hard time to actually realise, we want to slowly and carefully add tasks as we build out the team.

- **Project communications** 
- Monthly blog post
- Social media
- Mailing list
- Slack
- **Events and Advocacy**

### Events and Advocacy

It is important to us to create a space for our community to meet, engage, collaborate and learn from each other. Over the past months, we have participated in CloudNativeCon / KubeCon and at various meetups.

If you want to join the planning effort, please come and talk to us!

Also, if you would like to speak about OpenCost, do reach out - we are happy to help you find a speaking slot soon. The more the world hears about this, the better!

### Communications

We as a project want to make it a priority to inform our community and the wider world of developments well.
It's what helps new contributors get up to speed, enables collaboration, integrations and more.

The Community team helps with communication channels, including:

- [Our blog](https://opencost.io/blog)
- Slack (likely more to follow)
  - [#opencost](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/opencost)
- Social media
- [CNCF Blog](https://www.cncf.io/blog/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@CNCFOpenCost)

#### How to use this

##### As a maintainer or contributor

Add news-worthy items to our community meeting notes, so that our community maintainers can broadcast them appropriately! 

##### As a Community Maintainer

1. Check the community meeting notes and see if there are items that still need doing.
1. We would like to get monthly updates out to our community, so writing up content, getting quotes from relevant people, etc

## How to join

Talk to us in [`#opencost`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/opencost) on [Slack](https://slack.cncf.io) and let us know if you're interested in contributing.
We would love to have you part of the team.
